        <h1>OAuth in Acteur</h1>
        
        Implementing OAuth - particularly OAuth 2 - is no fun.  This library does
        not promise to make it fun.  What it does do is take care of all the
        bookkeeping necessary to support OAuth, so that adding support for new
        providers is as easy as possible.  And it provides a plugin model for
        adding providers - you still have to deal with the varied and often
        slightly incompatible vagaries of different providers' implementations
        of OAuth.
        <p/>
        This library also abstracts the notion of a "user" such that it is not
        tied to any particular persistence mechanism.
        <p/>
        <h2>The Basics</h2>
        To do OAuth with this library, you need to implement two things:
        <ul>
            <li><code><a href="OAuthPlugin.html">OAuthPlugin</a></code> - 
                this takes care of communication with the remote oauth provider
            </li>
            <li><code><a href="UserFactory.html">UserFactory</a></code> - 
                this takes care of persisting user data
            </li>
        </ul>
        Each OAuthPlugin has a human-readable name, a short, unique two-letter code used
        in cookies and the database, and a logo URL.
        
        <h2>User Properties</h2>
        Implementations of UserFactory need to be able to persist the following
        properties of a user;  nothing is dictated about how exactly such information
        is persisted, but a straightforward implementation would consist of
        two tables:
        <ul>
            <li>users - contains structured records of user identities, credential info and such</li>
            <li>login info - contains short-lived random strings used to validate callback requests from 
                 remote OAuth services</li>
        </ul>
        The following properties nominally belong to a user:
        <ul>
            <li>names - array of strings - names or email addresses that uniquely identify on user</li>
            <li>display name - a human-friendly name</li>
            <li>password - a hashed password for the user when using basic auth</li>
            <li>version - an incrementing version field updated when the user record is modified</li>
            <li>
                slugs - this is a mapping of service-name:properties.  A slug is a random,
                unique, hard-to-guess string which is hashed into the cookie which
                authenticates the user for normal requests (it is hashed with an 
                application-specific salt in order to make it as difficult to guess
                by an attacker as possible).  It has the following properties:
                <ul>
                    <li>slug value - this is the random string</li>
                    <li>slug date - the creation date - slugs can expire;  the expiration
                        should be the same as the remote oauth's expiration time</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        The complexity of slugs and cookies is handled by this library, but you do need
        to provide a way to store them.
        
        <h2>Use of Cookies</h2>
        When a user has been authenticated, a cookie is sent back to the browser, which
        can be used to efficiently authenticate subsequent requests for a period of
        time until the cookie expires.  For example, authenticating with Google might 
        result in a cookie like:
        <pre>
Set-Cookie: gg="jiNbV5c6+Qdl2MW+KOxbXflqwXOdGDcDpvnDndcyKYQtHSVAhrp4YNI3Hxa+p8vEpmxQY734lcgahRuaB910SQ==:tim@timboudreau.com"; Expires=Sun, 01 Sep 2013 08:52:34 GMT; Path=/; Domain=timboudreau.org
        </pre>
        
        The cookie value is simple:  It consists of <code>hashed-slug:username</code>.
        <p/>
        When a request with this cookie is received, what happens is:
        <ol>
            <li>We look up an <code><a href="OAuthPlugin.html">OAuthPlugin</a></code> whose
                <code>code()</code> method returns <code>gg</code></li>
            <li>Assuming that succeeded, the user <code>tim@timboudreau.com</code> is looked up</li>
            <li>We look up a slug named <code>gg</code> for that user - one should have been stored when the user
                was authenticated with Google</li>
            <li>We hash that slug together with an application-specific random salt and the user name, to 
                arrive at a value which should match the cookie contents
            </li>
            <li>If the cookie matches, we continue;  if not we return a response indicating we 
                need to re-authenticate
            </li>
        </ol>
        The result of this is that what the browser uses to authenticate most requests is
        unique data which is computed using different values across different applications
        (assuming you set the salt in your settings - if <code>production.mode</code> is
        true, the application will throw an error on startup if you don't set the salt),
        and hashed using SHA-512.  So, the probability of an attacker computing or guessing the right
        cookie value for a particular user for the particular time span the random slug
        was generated for is extremely low.
        
        <h2>Settings Affecting This Library</h2>
        As with the rest of Acteur, it uses the <a href="https://github.com/timboudreau/giulius">Guilius</a>
        for loading settings.  You can provide a Settings object on startup, which consists of
        default values from the classpath merged with files on disk (you provide a name, and the
        system will look for (<code>/etc/$NAME.properties</code>, <code>~/$NAME/properties</code>
        and <code>./$NAME.properties</code> and merge them together in that order).
        <p/>
        The following properties affect the operation of this library (all of these are provided
        as constants):
        <ul>
            <li><code>oauth.cookie.salt</code> - The salt used for hashing slugs.  This <b>must</b>
                be set when running in "production mode" (as you should do in production mode - 
                it simply means setting the setting <code>production.mode</code> to true)
                or a ConfigurationError will be thrown on startup.  Using the default salt
                would make the cookie value for a user predictable, meaning that it would
                be easy for user accounts to be spoofed.
            </li>
            <li><code>oauth.plugin.landing.page.base</code> - The base URL path for OAuth <i>landing pages</i> 
                which is passed to remote services as a callback URL.  The actual URL will be
                this value + <code>/</code> + oauthPlugin.code() for the plugin in question.
            </li>
            <li><code>oauth.plugin.bounce.page.base</code> - The base URL for "login with $SERVICE" pages
                which redirect to a remote provider.  The actual URL will be this value
                + <code>/</code> + oauthPlugin.code() for the plugin in question.
                This is used so that the system can provide a dynamic list of supported
                providers without requiring HTML changes.
            </li>
            <li><code>oauth.login.redirect</code> - The default destination page for landing pages to
            redirect to if one was not provided as a url parameter to the bounce page
            </li>
            <li><code>oauth.slug.max.age.hours</code> - The default maximum age in hours before a 
            slug should be considered expired.  Plugins can override this.</li>
            <li><code>oauth.cookie.path</code> - The path that should be used in login cookies</li>
        </ul>
