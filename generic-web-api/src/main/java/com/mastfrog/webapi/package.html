        <h2>Generic Web API API</h2>

        There is lots of support for writing REST APIs in Java;  there
        are fewer options for writing REST <i>clients</i> (some existing
        ones are described 
        <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/221442/rest-clients-for-java">here</a>).
        This library is the result of its author needing to write a REST client
        one too many times and not being satisfied with the options, and wanting
        one with an asynchronous, callback-based API - if you are writing an
        asynchronous
        web service which needs to call another web service, and calling the 
        remote service is not asynchronous too, then you instantly go from
        having a massively scalable web API to having one which is blocked
        doing I/O and scales worse than old-fashioned threaded alternatives.
        <p/>
        Calling REST APIs is simple enough that it's commonplace to do it with
        plain old Java code.  But what inevitably happens is that an entire
        codebase gets littered with boilerplate such as setting content types,
        literal paths and URLs and similar noise-code.  Then one day the API
        changes, and finding all of the places the code must be updated is a long,
        expensive and painful job that usually misses some cases.
        <p/>
        The idea here is to use some of Guice's injection features under the
        hood to make it very simple to define elements of a web API and pass
        arguments to construct a web call.  So you deal in objects, and those
        get translated into an HTTP call in a well-defined way in a well-defined
        place, but you don't have to write a lot of code to do those calls.
        <p/>
        It means that making a web call
        involves no repetitive boilerplate, and for most common cases, things
        like interpreting the response are handled.  More importantly, it 
        keeps things like URL paths all located in one place, so refactoring of
        a web api doesn't mean grepping your source code.  To call a web api,
        you simply pass an enum constant representing that call to an
        <a href="Invoker.html"><code>Invoker</code></a>, and some 
        objects to flesh out the call's URL, headers and or body - and you can
        literally pass as many objects in whatever order as you want - the 
        signature is 
        <code>invoker.call(Enum&lt;?&gt; call, Callback&lt;T&gt; callback, Object... args)</code>.

        <h2>Defining the Web API you want to call</h2>
        Your web api starts with a Java <code>Enum</code> which defines all of
        the calls in the API.  The enum must implement 
        <code><a href="WebCallEnum.html">WebCallEnum</a></code> which has a 
        single method, <code>get()</code> which returns an instance of 
        <code>WebCall</code>.  The enum serves as a handy way to reference
        API calls, and a way that the system (which uses Guice to bind object
        types) knows the entire list of types which might be used to construct
        web calls.
        <p/>
        Here's a sample API with two calls, one which says hello and one which
        echoes back the request body sent to it.
        <pre>
public enum TestAPI implements WebCallEnum &lcub;

    HELLO_WORLD(new WebCallBuilder()
                        .method(Method.GET)
                        .addRequiredType(UserId.class)
                        .withDecorator(DisplayName.class, ParameterFromClassNameAndToStringCamelCase.class)
                        .path(&quot;/users/&lcub;&lcub;userid&rcub;&rcub;/hello&quot;).responseType(Map.class)),
    ECHO(new WebCallBuilder()
                        .method(Method.POST)
                        .addRequiredType(String.class)
                        .addRequiredType(UserId.class)
                        .withDecorator(String.class, BodyFromString.class)
                        .path(&quot;/users/&lcub;&lcub;userid&rcub;&rcub;/echo&quot;).responseType(String.class));

    private final WebCall call;
    TestAPI(WebCallBuilder bldr) &lcub;
        call = bldr.id(this).build();
    &rcub;

    public WebCall get() &lcub;
        return call;
    &rcub;
&rcub;
        </pre>
        <h2>Calling The Web API</h2>
        How do we use it?  Very simply.  First, we need an instance of an
        <code><a href="Invoker.html">Invoker</a></code>;  you can either
        create one using Guice (you need to bind a base URL and an HttpClient),
        or use a static method to have it do that for you:
        <pre>
            Invoker&lt;TestAPI&gt; invoker = Invoker.create(URL.parse(&quot;http://server.example&quot;), 
                TestAPI.class);
        </pre>

        Then we need a callback which will be
        called when our call completes - it gets passed the result and can
        do whatever you need to with it:
        <pre>
Callback&lt;Map&gt; c = new Callback&lt;Map&gt;(Map.class) {
    public void success(Map object) {
        System.out.println("YAY: " + object);
    }
    public void fail(HttpResponseStatus status, ByteBuf bytes) {
        System.out.println("FAILED WITH " + status);
    }
};
        </pre>
        Then we simply pass the callback, and some arguments, to the invoker:
        <pre>
ResponseFuture f = invoker.call(TestAPI.HELLO_WORLD, c, 
    new DisplayName("Tim Boudreau"), new UserId("tim"));
        </pre>
        When the request completes, or if it fails, our callback will be called
        (there are a few other methods, such as exception handling, which can
        optionally be overridden).
        <p/>
        Under the hood, what happens is this:
        <ol>
            <li>
                We look up the <i>path template</i> tied to this web call - in
                this case <code>/users/&lcub;&lcub;userid&rcub;&rcub;/hello</code>.  The <code>&lcub;&lcub;userid&rcub;&rcub;</code>
                part will be substituted.  Fancy substitutions are possible by
                writing your own <a href="Interpolator.html"><code>Interpolator</code></a>,
                but "userid" matches the lower case name of the class <code>UserId</code> - 
                and we passed one in.  So its <code>toString()</code> is called, and
                "&lcub;&lcub;userid&rcub;&rcub;" is replaced with "tim".
            </li>
            <li>
                When we created the call, you may have noticed the line
                <code>.withDecorator(DisplayName.class, ParameterFromClassNameAndToStringCamelCase.class)</code>.
                We have a <code>DisplayName</code> class which is also a wrapper
                for a string.  <code><a href="builtin/ParameterFromClassNameAndToStringCamelCase.html">ParameterFromClassNameAndToStringCamelCase</a></code>
                is a <code><a href="Decorator.html">Decorator</a></code> which
                ships with this library.  It simply takes the simple class name and
                lower-cases it, and uses <code>toString()</code> on the value to 
                construct a query parameter.  So the actual URL we will call is
                now <code>http://server.example/users/tim/hello?displayName=Tim+Boudreau</code>
            </li>
            <li>
                An HTTP request with an empty body is constructed and sent to
                the server.
            </li>
            <li>
                Our callback takes a <code>Map</code> as its parameter.  So the
                code will take the response body, interpret it as JSON and 
                convert the content to a <code>Map</code> (using Jackson) and
                pass that to our callback.  We could also have asked for the content
                as an Image, String, ByteBuf, byte[], InputStream or Image, and it
                could have be unmarshalled transparently as any of those things;
                or if it is a type which Jackson can unmarshal from JSON, that
                can be done automatically.  For custom unmarshalling, you simply
                implement <code><a href="Interpreter.html">Interpreter</a></code>
                and add that to your <a href="WebCall.html"><code>WebCall</code></a>.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>ResponseFuture</h3>
        Making an API call returns a <code><a href="ResponseFuture.html">ResponseFuture</a></code>
        which you can use to cancel the call, or attach listeners to for events such
        as the response being sent, the headers being sent back, or even individual
        content chunks arriving.
        <p/>
        It also has two <code>await()</code> methods which will block the calling
        thread until the call has completed.  They are useful in unit tests
        and things like that; <i>please don't use them in non-test code!</i>
        For an overview of why Future is an antipattern, see this abstract <i>
            <a href="https://oracleus.activeevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=6385">Why Thereâ€™s No Future in Java Futures</a>
        </i>.  
        <p/>
        Essentially, the number one rule of using an asynchronous, message-based
        API is don't block, ever.

        <h3>Conclusions</h3>
        The result is that calling a web api is dirt-simple, scalable, and 
        relatively intuitive;  and since the entire definition of the API lives
        in one place, refactoring is simple - no searching code or guessing
        required.
